## "RFMainScreen"<br>
Layout: 3/4-2-2<br>
Fit for: X18, X20<br>
Why: Custom Layout for Rotorflight as per my preferences, with special considerations for compatibility with [BattSelector](https://github.com/BladeScraper-Designs/Ethos_BattSelector)

Standard 3-2-2 Layout:<br>

Alternate 4-2-2 Layout:<br>
There is also sufficient room to add a small fourth box in the left column to add another small Value widget:<br>

Due to the lower resolution of the X18 screen, the BattSelector widget will not fit with an additional box next to it, so only the standard 3-2-2 is available:<br>

Note the widgets themselves are not included/preconfigured, this Lua only creates the layout!  Widgets shown above are all Value widgets, plus my own [BattSelector](https://github.com/BladeScraper-Designs/Ethos_BattSelector) and Rob Thomson's [RFSUITE](https://github.com/robthomson/rotorflight-lua-ethos-suite)->Rotorflight Governor widget.
