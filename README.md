# Layouts
Custom screen layouts for Ethos<br>
Currently compatible with X20 and X18, other radios not added yet

## Rotorflight Main Screen<br>
3 Column: 3/4-2-2 Layout<br>

Standard 3/2/2 Layout:<br>

There is also sufficient room to add a small fourth box in the left column to add another small Value widget:<br>

Due to the lower resolution of the X18 screen, the 4/2/2 screen cannot be added, so only the standard 3-2-2 is available:<br>

Note the widgets themselves are not included/preconfigured, this Lua only creates the layout!  Widgets shown above are all Value widgets, plus my own BattSelector and Rob Thomson's RFSUITE->Rotorflight Governor widget.
