# Layouts
Custom screen layouts for Ethos<br>
![](https://github.com/BladeScraper-Designs/Ethos_Layouts/blob/main/img/Select.png?raw=true)<br>

## Rotorflight Main Screen<br>
Layout: 3/4-2-2<br>
Fit for: X18, X20<br>
Designed for: Custom Layout<br>
Special Considerations: Compatibility with [BattSelector](https://github.com/BladeScraper-Designs/Ethos_BattSelector)

Standard 3-2-2 Layout:<br>

Alternate 4-2-2 Layout:<br>
There is also sufficient room to add a small fourth box in the left column to add another small Value widget:<br>

Due to the lower resolution of the X18 screen, the BattSelector widget will not fit with an additional box next to it, so only the standard 3-2-2 is available:<br>

Note the widgets themselves are not included/preconfigured, this Lua only creates the layout!  Widgets shown above are all Value widgets, plus my own BattSelector and Rob Thomson's RFSUITE->Rotorflight Governor widget.
